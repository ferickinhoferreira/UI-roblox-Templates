# Project Finity Library
**Project Finity** has a variety of different modules for you to customize your cheat. Below is the documentation on how to use each of them.
## Documentation
### Finity
```lua
local Finity = loadstring(game:HttpGet("http://finity.vip/scripts/finity_lib.lua"))()
```
Use the above line of code before you run any of **Project Finity's** UI methods.

#### Constructor
|Constructor| Description | Return Types |
|--|--|--|
| Finity.new([, boolean is_dark_mode]) | Creates a new Finity pseudo-instance. | FinityWindow

#### Properties
| Property | Default Value |
|--|--|
| is_dark_mode | **false** |
| toggle_key | Enum.KeyCode.**Semicolon** |

### FinityWindow
```lua
local FinityWindow = Finity.new(true) -- 'true' means dark mode is enabled
```
A **FinityWindow** is essentially the main backbone of the UI.
#### Methods
| Method | Description | Return Types |
|--|--|--|
| FinityWindow:Category(string name) | Creates a new FinityCategory with a name. | FinityCategory |
| FinityWindow.ChangeToggleKey(**Enum** keycode) | Changes the key to toggle the window. | nil|

> Because of the way Finity works, multiple categories with the same name are allowed, _however_, it may be confusing for your users.

### FinityCategory
```lua
local FinityCategory = FinityWindow:Category("name") -- name is the name of the FinityCategory
```
A **FinityCategory** is an easy and dynamic way to categorize the modules of the script you're making into general categories.

For example, let's say I was making a cheat for Apocalypse Rising 2: I would be able to use multiple FinityCategory instances to be able to categorize different types of cheats, such as Visuals, Guns, Items, Zombies, and/or Client cheat. You get the idea, right? Cool beans!

Below are the methods of a FinityCategory.
#### Methods
| Method | Description | Return Types |
|--|--|--|
| FinityCategory:Sector(**string** name) | Creates a new FinitySector with a name. | FinitySector |

> Because of the way Finity works, multiple sectors with the same name are allowed, _however_, it may be confusing for your users. Less confusing than duplicate categories, I hope. ðŸ˜…

#### Properties
| Property | Default Value |
|--|--|
| name | nil |


### FinitySector
```lua
local FinitySector = FinityCategory:Sector("name") -- name is the name of the FinityCategory
```
A **FinitySector** instance is essentially a mini-category, allowing for even more categorization.

For example, it would allow you to sub-categorize a "Visuals" category into things like "Player Visuals," "Zombie Visuals," and "Item Visuals."

Below are the methods associated with a **FinitySector**.

#### Methods
| Method | Description | Return Types |
|--|--|--|
| FinitySector:Cheat(**string** type,**string** name [, **function** callback, **array** data]) | Creates a new FinityCheat with a type and a name. (Optional: callback function & data) | FinityCheat |

#### Properties
| Property | Default Value |
|--|--|
| Name | nil |


### FinityCheat
```lua
local FinityCheat = FinitySector:Cheat("type", "name", function (NewValue)
    print(NewValue)
end, {})
```
A **FinityCheat** is a cheat modules useful for hooking callbacks to toggles in order to have a smooth and organized script.

There are many different types of cheat modules. Here's a table to compare them all:
| Cheat Module Type | Description |
|--|--|
| Checkbox | The checkbox is useful for having a user control the state of something. Fires callback with the new state of the checkbox. |
| Dropdown | The dropdown is useful for having a user choose from a list of things. Fires the callback with the option that was chosen as a string. |
| Slider | The slider is useful for having a user choose between a range of numbers. Fires the callback with the new value of the slider. |
| Textbox | The textbox is useful for having the user enter a custom value. Fires the callback with the new value of the textbox as a string. |
| Button | The button is nice for a user to trigger a specific action. Fires the callback when clicked with no arguments. |
| Keybind | The keybind is useful for performing an action when a key is pressed. Fires the callback when the key is changed or pressed. |
| Colorpicker | This is nice for choosing a certain color in range. Fires the callback each time the color is changed with the new Color3. |
